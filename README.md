# Diablo II: Resurrected Mod Manager

D2RMM is a mod manager for Diablo II: Resurrected.

Instead of distributing new versions of files for D2 to use, this mod manager operates on mods that describe _how_ D2's files should be changed.

This allows you to include multiple mods together even if they modify the same files (e.g. multiple mods that all add Horadric Cube recipes).

In order to use it, you must have vanilla D2 files extracted (e.g. using [Ladiks Casc Viewer](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)) and available at `<D2 Directory>/mods/Vanilla/Vanilla.mpq/data`.

You can find some example mods over at [https://github.com/olegbl/d2rmm.mods](https://github.com/olegbl/d2rmm.mods).
