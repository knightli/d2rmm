# Diablo II: Resurrected Mod Manager

D2RMM is a mod manager for Diablo II: Resurrected.

Instead of distributing new versions of files for D2 to use, this mod manager operates on mods that describe _how_ D2's files should be changed. This allows you to include multiple mods together even if they modify the same files (e.g. multiple mods that all add Horadric Cube recipes).

## Usage

- Extract the Mod Manager anywhere you want.
- Extract mod archives into the mods directory inside the Mod Manager's directory.
- Run mod manager, tell it where to find D2R in settings tab, hit "intall mods".
- Drag-n-drop mods to change load order. Hit settings button on any mod that has settings to configure it.

## Example Mods
